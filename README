Here are some notes on tools used for e-mails scraping from clutch and generating mailing lists for MailMerge Thunderbird extension

The flow is as follows:

1) Generating clutch.com/profile/blah -like urls list

We open clutch.co with some list of companies, like: https://clutch.co/web-developers?geona_id=40823 in the browser. This list contains links to clutch profile pages, like https://clutch.co/profile/gecko-lab

I haven't found any way of getting "normal" webpages' urls for companies, but it's possible to make a list of those profile pages. You can then copy them to "Firmy z clutcha" sheet and work with such list.

In order to create such a list, copy the contents (source) of the clutch page aforementioned (one with list, /web-developers?geona_id=40823) and paste it to some file (dupa.html). Then call:
./list_clutch_addresses.sh path_to_file.txt
There are some old pages I've used on this repo, so call ./list_clutch_addresses.sh Archives/OldClutchPages/page20.txt to understand what you should see.

You paste it to "Clutch" column in the "Firmy developerskie" doc

You can now select them and open in background tabs (select multiple, right click, "Zobacz wiÄ™cej czynnoÅ›ci..., OtwÃ³rz linki").

It opens _clutch_ pages for subsequent companies in tabs, so you can open companies' pages by clicking the companies' names and use a plugin to look for e-mails

Here is plugin:

2) Generating csv for MailMerge

Batch e-mailing is done using the MailMerge addon for Thunderbird.

Copy mails from a column (with Shift or Ctrl/Command) OR copy both companies names and e-mails (they have to be in the same appropriate rows and number of companies has to be equal to the number of e-mails) (with Ctrl/Command) if the desired mail template has a placeholder for company name (as {{LastName}} )

Run ./create_a_csv_for_copied.rb - it uses the data in clipboard and generates .csv file (shown as output and also copied to clipboard)

Companies' names are in the "LastName" column, so that they could be used with MailMerge. Details on how to use should appear when running the script.


3) Run MailMerge with appropriate template.

In "To" field put:
{{Email}}

If you want to use a template with company name, use {{LastName}} as a placeholder.

I usually add my personal e-mail with some test company name as a first item in the csv, to test whether everything's ok.

Click the "Mail Merge" icon in the message window, set the source to CSV, set file to the appropriate csv. Leave charset and separator as defaults.

Set Pause value to 1200 and select Random - this should give frequency of 1 e-mail per 10 minutes, on average: the delay is in seconds, and the random is distributed uniformly, so the average value is 600s => 10 min.
