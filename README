Here are some notes on tools used for e-mails scraping from clutch and generating mailing lists for MailMerge Thunderbird extension

The flow is as follows:

1) Generating clutch.com/profile/blah -like urls list
We open clutch.co with some list of companies, like: https://clutch.co/web-developers?geona_id=40823 in the browser. This list contains links to clutch profile pages, like https://clutch.co/profile/gecko-lab

I haven't found any way of getting "normal" webpages' urls for companies, but it's possible to make a list of those profile pages. You can then copy them to "Firmy z clutcha" sheet and work with such list.

In order to create such a list, copy the contents (source) of the clutch page aforementioned (one with list, /web-developers?geona_id=40823) and paste it to some file (dupa.html). Then call:
./list_clutch_addresses.sh path_to_file.txt
There are some old pages I've used on this repo, so call ./list_clutch_addresses.sh Archives/OldClutchPages/page20.txt to understand what you should see.

You paste it to "Clutch" column in the "Firmy developerskie" doc

You can now select them and open in background tabs (select multiple, right click, "Zobacz więcej czynności..., Otwórz linki").

It opens _clutch_ pages for subsequent companies in tabs, so you can open companies' pages by clicking the companies' names and use a plugin to look for e-mails

Here is plugin:

2) Generating csv for MailMerge

Batch e-mailing is done using the MailMerge addon for Thunderbird.

Copy mails from a column (with Shift or Ctrl/Command) OR copy both companies names and e-mails (they have to be in the same appropriate rows and number of companies has to be equal to the number of e-mails) (with Ctrl/Command) if the desired mail template has a placeholder for company name (as {{LastName}} )

Run ./create_a_csv_for_copied.rb - it uses the data in clipboard and generates .csv file (shown as output and also copied to clipboard)

Companies' names are in the "LastName" column, so that they could be used with MailMerge. Details on how to use should appear when running the script.


3) Run MailMerge with appropriate template.

In "To" field put:
{{Email}}

If you want to use a template with company name, use {{LastName}} as a placeholder.

I usually add my personal e-mail with some test company name as a first item in the csv, to test whether everything's ok.

Click the "Mail Merge" icon in the message window, set the source to CSV, set filt to the appropriate csv. Leave charset and separator as defaults.

Set Pause value to 1200 and select Random - this should give frequency of 1 e-mail per 10 minutes, on average: the delay is in seconds, and the random is ditributed uniformly, so the average value is 600s => 10 min.

4) Other hacks

There is one problem with Thunderbird + MailMerge: as far as I understand, it can be only configured as one sender identity (address). And I haven't found any reasonable way to run mutiple instances of Thunderbird on MacOS.

At first, I was using virtual machines (VirtualBox and then UTM) with Linux, with Thunderbird and MailMerge on each one. But they're both heavy (distro has to have GUI for running Thunderbird) and unreliable (for some reason network connection seems to fail after a few hours). 

Tl;dr:

The solution I've found is to use Thunderbird _docker image_:

https://github.com/jlesage/docker-thunderbird

You run as many containers as you want with this guy, it's possible to download MailMerge via Thunderbird plugin manager. The Thunderbird is accessible via web browser, as localhost:PORT_NUMBER

It's quite light and very stable. The initial installation took me a few minutes, but I guess I'm not familiar with docker.

The only caveat is that you have to map each one to different port, so after running, for instance, the first one on 5800

/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker run -d \
    --name=thunderbird2 \
        -p 5800:5800 \
            -v ~/DockerThunderbird/dockershared2:/config:rw \
                jlesage/thunderbird

... the subsequent ones look like this:


/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker run -d \
    --name=thunderbird3 \
        -p 5801:5800 \
            -v ~/DockerThunderbird/dockershared3:/config:rw \
                jlesage/thunderbird

The first one can be accessed in your web browser at localhost:5800, the second one as localhost:5801 etc.

You provide .csv for MailMerge by putting it in ~/DockerThunderbird/dockershared[number] directory (I mean arbitrary, specified as a param -v above).
